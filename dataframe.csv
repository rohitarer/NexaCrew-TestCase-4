Through the fusion of artiﬁcial intelligence and data, these chatbots have the capability to provide automated services, optimize customer experiences, and reduce workloads for employees. These chatbots can offer 24/7 support, answer questions, perform transactions, and provide rapid information, contributing signiﬁcantly to the sustainable development processes of businesses and organizations. ChatGPT has already been applied in various ﬁelds. However, to ensure that there is a chatbot providing accurate and useful information in a narrow domain, it is necessary to build, train, and ﬁne-tune the model based on speciﬁc data. In this paper, we introduce EduChat, a chatbot system for university-related questions. EduChat is an effective artiﬁcial intelligence application designed by combining rule-based methods, an innovative improved random forest machine learning approach, and ChatGPT to automatically answer common questions related to universities, academic programs, admission procedures, student life, and other related topics. This chatbot system helps provide quick and easy information to users, thereby reducing the time spent searching for information directly from source documents or contacting support staff. The experiments have yielded positive results. Keywords: engineering; chatbot engineering; AI-based chatbot; EduChat; improved random forest; University Consulting 1. Introduction “Chatbot”, an abbreviation for “chat robot”, is an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-based conversational entity designed to simulate human conversation. Chatbots have emerged as an innovative technology, transforming how humans interact with machines and ser- vices. This technology, driven by advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, enables smooth and efﬁcient communication between users and digital systems. Chatbots ﬁnd applications in various diverse ﬁelds, from customer support, e-commerce, healthcare, to education, thanks to their real-time responsiveness, personaliza- tion capabilities, and task automation. In recent years, one of the notable advancements in chatbot research is the work by Brown et al. (2020) [ 1]. This paper introduces GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), a language model with a staggering 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 demonstrates remark- able language understanding and generation abilities by producing human-like responses. Prior to that, the work of Zhang et al. (2019) [ 2] introduced DialoGPT, a variant of the GPT-2 model ﬁne-tuned for generating responses in conversations. By ﬁne-tuning on con- versational data, DialoGPT enhances the ﬂuency and relevance of the generated responses.

understanding and generation abilities by producing human-like responses. Prior to that, the work of Zhang et al. (2019) [ 2] introduced DialoGPT, a variant of the GPT-2 model ﬁne-tuned for generating responses in conversations. By ﬁne-tuning on con- versational data, DialoGPT enhances the ﬂuency and relevance of the generated responses. Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning a chatbot in the open research domain created by Adiwardana et al. (2020), named Meena [ 3], which utilizes adversarial training methods to generate interesting and contextually relevant responses. This research highlights the importance of creating meaningful conversations. Particularly in [ 4], Reddy et al. (2021) Appl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446. https://doi.org/10.3390/app132212446 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsciAppl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 2 of 13 introduced the DALL-E system—an image generation system based on text descriptions. This opens up the possibility of expanding the communication capabilities of chatbots beyond text, allowing for the display and comprehension of images. These research advancements demonstrate the unique evolution of chatbots, pushing the boundaries of what AI-driven entities can achieve. From comprehensive language understanding to image generation and maintaining meaningful conversations, these breakthroughs highlight the potential of chatbots in diverse applications. Chatbots have come a long way from rule-based systems, evolving into advanced AI entities with the ability to comprehend context, emotions, and specialized domains. Breakthrough studies like the examples of GPT-3, DialoGPT, Meena, and DALL-E have showcased signiﬁcant progress in the capabilities of chatbots. Constructing a chatbot for a speciﬁc domain presents substantial challenges in industry knowledge and methods. It necessitates a profound grasp of context, terminology, and industry trends to deliver precise information. The ﬂexible application of natural language processing and machine/deep learning methods is crucial, utilizing efﬁcient models and algorithms. This paper introduces EduChat, a chatbot system designed to address questions related to universities. EduChat is an artiﬁcial intelligence application that combines rule- based methods with novel machine learning techniques to automatically answer common queries related to universities, academic programs, admission procedures, student life, and other related topics. Within EduChat, we have also integrated the ChatGPT system to enhance the coverage of conversation and improve the interaction between humans and machines. To understand the conversations sent to EduChat, we process these sentences in a three-level sequence. First, the text sentences sent to the system are processed by a rule-based system deﬁned by the Deﬁnite Clause Grammar (DCG) syntax [ 5,6]. If the DCG rules fail to recognize the syntactic and semantic structures of the dialogues, an enhanced algorithm built upon the random forest machine learning approach [ 7] is used to classify these sentences into one of the 25 topic classes. Through experimentation, we establish a classiﬁcation threshold based on accuracy. Sentences with classiﬁcation scores below the threshold are processed by ChatGPT within the system’s context. Figure 1 depicts a snippet of a conversation from EduChat. Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15 methods to generate interesting and contextually relevant responses.

by ChatGPT within the system’s context. Figure 1 depicts a snippet of a conversation from EduChat. Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15 methods to generate interesting and contextually relevant responses. This research high- lights the importance of creating meaningful conversations. Particularly in [4], Reddy et al. (2021) introduced the DALL-E system—an image generation system based on text de- scriptions. This opens up the possibility of expanding the communication capabilities of chatbots beyond text, allowing for the display and comprehension of images. These research advancements demonstrate the unique evolution of chatbots, pushing the boundaries of what AI-driven entities can achieve. From comprehensive language un- derstanding to image generation and maintaining meaningful conversations, these break- throughs highlight the potential of chatbots in diverse applications. Chatbots have come a long way from rule-based systems, evolving into advanced AI entities with the ability to comprehend context, emotions, and specialized domains. Breakthrough studies like the examples of GPT-3, DialoGPT, Meena, and DALL-E have showcased signiﬁcant progress in the capabilities of chatbots. Constructing a chatbot for a speciﬁc domain presents substantial challenges in indus- try knowledge and methods. It necessitates a profound grasp of context, terminology, and industry trends to deliver precise information. The ﬂexible application of natural language processing and machine/deep learning methods is crucial, utilizing eﬃcient models and algorithms. This paper introduces EduChat, a chatbot system designed to address ques- tions related to universities. EduChat is an artiﬁcial intelligence application that combines rule-based methods with novel machine learning techniques to automatically answer common queries related to universities, academic programs, admission procedures, stu- dent life, and other related topics. Within EduChat, we have also integrated the ChatGPT system to enhance the coverage of conversation and improve the interaction between hu- mans and machines. To understand the conversations sent to EduChat, we process these sentences in a three-level sequence. First, the text sentences sent to the system are pro- cessed by a rule-based system deﬁned by the Deﬁnite Clause Grammar (DCG) syntax [5], [6]. If the DCG rules fail to recognize the syntactic and semantic structures of the dia- logues, an enhanced algorithm built upon the random forest machine learning approach [7] is used to classify these sentences into one of the 25 topic classes. Through experimen- tation, we establish a classiﬁcation threshold based on accuracy. Sentences with classiﬁca- tion scores below the threshold are processed by ChatGPT within the system’s context. Figure 1 depicts a snippet of a conversation from EduChat. Figure 1. A conversation example with EduChat. (User: Hi EduChat: Hello! I am an AI-based sup- port staﬀ member at the university.

What effective method to build a chatbot to support a speciﬁc domain such as issues related to universities? 2. For languages with limited resources such as Vietnamese, does the combination of various methods without relying on deep learning bring effectiveness? The main contributions of this paper are as follows:  With only a small dataset in the low-resource Vietnamese language, we have proposed an efﬁcient hybrid method to construct a robust chatbot system for the ﬁeld of education.  Within EduChat, for managing dialogues within the specialized domain, we have established an effective set of rules using DCG and introduced the improved random forest algorithm to enhance text classiﬁcation accuracy.  The model presented in this paper can be applied to various systems, across different contexts and languages. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work to contextualize our research. In Section 3, we introduce the proposed model. Sections 4 and 5 detail the components of EduChat. Experimental results will be discussed in Section 6. Finally, this paper concludes in Section 7, summarizing key ﬁndings and proposing future directions. 2. Related Work In this section, we will offer a broad overview of chatbot deployment techniques, including rule-based chatbots and artiﬁcial intelligence-driven chatbots (AI). 2.1. Rule-Based Chatbots Initially, the earliest chatbot implementations relied on rule-based models. These models are typically simpler to design and implement but have certain limitations in terms of functionality. They face challenges when dealing with complex queries. Rule-based chatbots respond to user queries by searching for pattern matches, which makes them prone to providing incorrect answers when encountering sentences that lack recognized patterns. The advantage of rule-based methods is that, despite the challenges of manually encoding matching rules, they yield high-accuracy results for speciﬁc domains and speciﬁc scopes. Several noteworthy rule-based chatbot projects include the following: In [ 8], the authors present a rule-based inquiry chatbot designed exclusively for Asia Paciﬁc University (APU) students, known as the ‘APU Admin Bot’. This chatbot is engineered to provide students with a more efﬁcient means of addressing their inquiries, reducing the need for extensive interaction with administrative	Chunk 4	[-0.041944806,

the following: In [ 8], the authors present a rule-based inquiry chatbot designed exclusively for Asia Paciﬁc University (APU) students, known as the ‘APU Admin Bot’. This chatbot is engineered to provide students with a more efﬁcient means of addressing their inquiries, reducing the need for extensive interaction with administrative ofﬁces. It functions on a rule-based framework for pattern recognition, whereby speciﬁc words, phrases, and actions trigger predeﬁned responses from the chatbot. In [ 9], a chatbot is described that directs users towards speciﬁc actions by employing established rules and decision trees. These scripts and regulations come preconﬁgured, and any modiﬁcations require manual intervention by the organization. One of the initial alternative therapies explored in this project is cognitive behavioral therapy. The authors in [ 10] introduce an automated method for extracting Artiﬁcial Intelligence Markup Language rules from genuine Twitter conversation data. 2.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence-Driven Chatbots In contrast to rule-based models, AI models rely on machine learning algorithms that enable them to learn from an existing database of human conversations. To achieve this, they require training using machine learning algorithms and a training dataset. With the application of machine learning algorithms, there is no longer a necessity to manually create and code new pattern matching rules. This ﬂexibility liberates chatbots from de- pendency on domain-speciﬁc knowledge. Some exemplary projects applying AI-based methods are as follows. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is an iteration of GPT-3 that has been purpose-built for engaging in conversational interactions, offering articulate andAppl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 4 of 13 context-aware responses in natural language. BlenderBot, created by Facebook, is a chatbot that fuses extensive neural models with techniques for multi-turn conversations, with the objective of participating in more substantial and logically connected dialogues [ 11]. IBM’s Project Debater [ 12] is an artiﬁcial intelligence system specialized in debating with humans, proﬁcient at presenting comprehensive and well-structured arguments using natural language. AI-based chatbots have been applied in various ﬁelds, ranging from healthcare [13,14], entertainment [15,16], to education [17–20]. 3. The Proposed Model The proposed model aims to improve the understanding and interaction capabilities of the chatbot in complex situations, thereby enhancing the user experience. EduChat operates according to the following mechanism: 1. Start: EduChat initiates the conversation with a welcoming message. 2. User Input: Users send messages, which can be either questions (queries) or statements. 3. Understanding and Message Classiﬁcation: EduChat comprehends the intent and context of the messages as follows: # If the user’s input falls within the context of the application:  EduChat provides relevant responses by using predeﬁned answers or ac- cessing information from the knowledge base. # If the user’s input indicates a request beyond the scope of the application:  EduChat acknowledges the request and forwards it to ChatGPT to address such queries. 4. Conclusion: When user questions have been resolved or when users indicate they have completed their interaction, EduChat concludes the conversation. EduChat bids farewell or provides concluding information. The following modules are designed to implement the operating mechanism described	Chunk 5	[-0.021403078, -0.052407943, -0.0719735, 0.008561087, 0.056845095, 0.031548534, 0.01895474, -0.0037483058,

the request and forwards it to ChatGPT to address such queries. 4. Conclusion: When user questions have been resolved or when users indicate they have completed their interaction, EduChat concludes the conversation. EduChat bids farewell or provides concluding information. The following modules are designed to implement the operating mechanism described above (illustrated in Figure 2):  User Interface: A web-based chat window serving as the user interface.  Conversation Management: Manages the ﬂow of the conversation. This ensures that EduChat responds appropriately to user input, adheres to the context, and maintains a smooth conversation.  Knowledge Base: Contains information that EduChat can use to answer user queries. The knowledge base includes frequently asked questions, help guides, and other university-related information.  Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module: This module allows EduChat to under- stand and process human language. Its role involves parsing the syntax and semantics of text messages.  Machine Learning Module: EduChat is equipped with machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence approaches to comprehend and respond to messages that the NLP module cannot handle.  ChatGPT API: EduChat is integrated with ChatGPT through an API to handle mes- sages evaluated as below the threshold by the machine learning module. The EduChat model utilizes an NLP module and an improved random forest machine learning module as two main modules to process input data and generate responses. The algorithm of the EduChat model is described as follows (Algorithm 1).Appl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 5 of 13 Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15 Figure 2. EduChat system architecture.

DCG syntax and semantics rules was loaded into this variable. model: an instance of the improved random forest (IRF) model. db: database object. gpt: an instance of ChatGPTConnector, which helps connect to ChatGPT via Open AI’s APIs. 1. user_input = encode(user_input) # user input in Vietnamese will be preprocessed, standardized and encoded. 2. task = prolog.query(user_input) # try to parse the syntax and semantics of user input 3. if task is None then 4. predicted_task, prob = model.predict_prob(user_input) # The IRF model will predict and give the probability of each class. If the maximum probability value is greater than the system’s configuration threshold, the system will accept this classification value. 5. if prob ≥ threshold then 6. task = predicted_task 7. if task is not None then 8. response = db.query(task) 9. else 10. response = gpt.post(conversation, user_input) 11. return response end function Figure 2. EduChat system architecture. Algorithm 1. EduChat Algorithm function EduChat(conversation) Input : conversation Output : response content for the user Variables : user_input : the newest user’s message	Chunk 6	[-0.015219159, -0.020493517,

Natural Language Processing (NLP) NLP plays a crucial role in chatbot development. It enables the chatbot to understand and interact with human language naturally, thereby improving its ability to respond and understand user intent. Thanks to NLP , a chatbot can handle a wide range of questions and requests, providing users with a smooth and efﬁcient interaction experience. We conducted a survey and collected 625 text messages from exchanges with students involving 06 academic advisors and 02 student affairs staff members from HUFLIT University andAppl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 6 of 13 Tien Giang University. These messages were categorized into 25 topics, and some typical message types are presented in Table 1. Table 1.

(English: To apply for a tuition fee exemption or reduction, who should I contact?)query (contact (mienhocphi)) The scope of the EduChat application includes clear rules and logic, and situations that can be predicted. The data within EduChat is also limited and straightforward. This helps us choose a method based on a set of rules and conditions to handle every situation. To represent the semantics of the text messages, we use DCG [ 5,6], also known as “Prolog-style grammars”. DCG is a method in NLP and computational linguistics that employs logic-based grammar. DCG is built upon the grammar of logical propositions. Each proposition typically consists of a head and a body, where the head contains a statement, and the body contains the necessary conditions for that statement to be satisﬁed. DCG is a powerful tool in the ﬁeld of NLP and is suitable for building chatbot systems.Appl.

Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 8 of 13 Example 1: “Ph òng Công tác sinh vi ên cho em h /uni1ECFi th/uni1EE7t/uni1EE5c làm gi/uni1EA5y xác nh/uni1EADn sinh vi ên nhưth/uni1EBFnào?” (English: The Student Affairs Ofﬁce, I would like to ask how to go about obtaining a student certiﬁcate?) The DCG syntax and semantics rules are deﬁned as follows: query (query (Dept, Task)) --> n_dept, n_dept (Dept), n_phrase, v_how, n_task (Task), w_how. n_dept --> [ph òng]. n_dept (dept(Dept)) --> n_depts (Dept). n_phrase --> [cho, em, h /uni1ECFi]. n_depts (ctsv) --> [c ông, tác, sinh, vi ên]. v_how --> [th /uni1EE7, t/uni1EE5c, làm]. n_task (task(Task)) --> n_tasks(Task). n_tasks (xacnhan) --> [gi /uni1EA5y, xác, nh/uni1EADn, sinh, vi ên]. w_how --> [nh ư, th/uni1EBF, nào]. We obtain the syntax and semantics rules that deﬁne the semantic structure of query example 1 as follows: query (dept (ctsv), task (xacnhan)). From these semantic structures, we proceed to convert them into corresponding SQL queries for database/knowledge base retrieval. The results returned from the database/ knowledge base are processed to provide responses to the user. 5. Intent Classiﬁer Based on Improved Random Forest Algorithm (Machine Learning Module) We propose an intent classiﬁer based on improved random forest to handle cases where the NLP module described in Section 4 cannot resolve incoming messages. In such cases, the messages are automatically classiﬁed into one of the 25 groups corresponding to the 25 semantic structures presented in Table 1. To ensure sufﬁcient data for applying machine learning methods, we perform data augmentation as presented by Section 5.1. 5.1. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is a technique introduced to enhance the accuracy of training deep learning models by expanding the dataset necessary for the training process. For instance, the work of Wei et al. [ 21] introduced data augmentation techniques that utilize internal data rather than relying on language models and external sources. These techniques encompassed synonym replacement, which substitutes a speciﬁc word in a sentence with a synonym; random insertion, which adds a random word; random swap, which exchanges the positions of two random words in a sentence; and random deletion, which removes a random word. We conducted text augmentation based on the idea from Wei et al. [ 21] and obtained a dataset comprising 6250 text sentence samples categorized into 25 classes. The data preprocess- ing steps included tokenization, stop word removal, and feature extraction using TF-IDF. 5.2. The Improved Random Forest (IRF) Algorithm Random forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm introduced by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler in 2001 [ 7]. It quickly became an important tool in building predictive models and analyzing data. random forest works by creating an ensemble of multiple random decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a bootstrap sample, which is a subset of the original data. This helps reduce the risk of overﬁtting, a common issue in machine learning. When making predictions, random forest aggregates the results from all the decision trees to provide the ﬁnal	Chunk 10	[-0.03961811, 0.019426415, -0.043074094, -0.033302076, 0.0092642065, 0.04071764,

random decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a bootstrap sample, which is a subset of the original data. This helps reduce the risk of overﬁtting, a common issue in machine learning. When making predictions, random forest aggregates the results from all the decision trees to provide the ﬁnal prediction. random forest has several advantages, including its ability to handle noisy and large datasets, its applicability to classiﬁcation and prediction tasks, and its capability to estimate the importance of input variables. The equation for deﬁning the mean square error (MSE) of a random forest is as follows. MSE =1 Nån k=0n k (FiFi)b2(1)Appl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 9 of 13 In Equation (1), Nrepresents the total count of unique data points, where Firepresents the predicted outcome provided by model Yi, and icorresponds to the speciﬁc data point in question. In the system, the IRF algorithm consists of 02 main phases: training and testing. Training phase. During the training phase, the standard random forest algorithm is enhanced by introducing a cost function that relies on the misclassiﬁcation rate of the samples. The misclassiﬁcation rate of the samples is calculated by assessing the false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) values in the confusion matrix for each decision tree during the training process. cost(T) = (FN( T) + FP( T)/|size(T)| (2) where FN(T) represents the count of false negatives in a tree T, FP(T) signifies the count of false positives in tree T, and |size(T)| denotes the number of samples in the training set of tree T. Subsequently , an error-based technique is devised to allocate weights to each tree. This error is computed in 02 components: the overall training error and the positive training error. The overall training error is computed by considering the total misclassiﬁcation of samples within a tree. The overall positive error is computed based on the minority class samples in a tree. In detail, the error calculation is deﬁned as: err_ov(xi)=1 :i f y(xi)6=class (xi) 0 :i f y(xi)=class (xi)(3) err_pos(xm)=1 :i f y(xm)6=positive 0 :i f y(xm)=positive(4) where x iis a sample in a tree, y(x i) is the class of x iassigned by the tree, and x mis a minority class sample in the tree. If more than one tree exhibits the same overall training error, the tree with the lowest overall positive error is assigned a higher weight. The cost function reflects the predictive capability of the tree, while the weight formula- tion indicates the confidence level associated with a tree. The optimal tree is determined by selecting the one with both the highest predictive ability and the highest confidence value. The complete training process is outlined in the Algorithm 2.

IRF_1 Input: Sis dataset, Sminis minority class set, Smajis majority class set, n: number of trees. Output: Weighted trees’ set, { weight (T):Tis a tree} 1. Split the set Sinto train and test. 2. By sampling with replacement, divide train into ntraining sets, termed as T. 3. For i:= 1 to ndo (a) Split Tinto Tmajand Tmin:TmajSmaj,TminSmin. (b) Train Twith decision tree learning algorithm. (c) Compute the overall error using Equations (2) and (3) as: err_ov(T)=N å m=1err_ov(xi)cost(T) N= total number of samples in the tree T. (d) Compute the positive training error, using Equations (2) and (4) as err_pos(T)=p å m=1err_pos(xm)cost(T) pis total number of minority instances in the tree T. (e) Assign the tree Tiwith weight (Ti) = 1/ err_ov (Ti) Tree with lower error will obtain higher weight. (f) In case that the overall training errors of the two or more trees are the same, the weights are assigned using the formula: weight (Ti) = 1/ err_pos (Ti) Testing phase. During the testing phase, the result for each sample in the test set is determined by assessing it against each of the trained decision trees and then aggregatingAppl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 10 of 13 the outcomes obtained from all the trees. In a standard random forest, the ﬁnal result or label for a test sample is established by considering the majority vote from all the outcomes generated by the individual trees. However, in the case of IRF, the ﬁnal outcome is decided based on the weight assigned to a speciﬁc selected tree. For a given test pattern, x’ the ﬁnal outcome, F(x’) is given as: F(x’) =f(x’) from Ti|weight (Ti) = highest (5) In other words, the result obtained from the tree with the highest weight for a given test sample is taken as the ultimate outcome. The entire testing process is depicted in Algorithm 3. Algorithm 3. IRF_2 Input :testis the set of test samples, W= {weight (T)} is the set of weights of all trees T. Ouput : Classiﬁed test set 1. Classify testwith all the trees 2. For each sample x’ intest (a) for each tree Tiin the forest obtains the outcome label as y(x’) =f(x’) from Ti (b) determine the ﬁnal outcome, F(x’) by using Equation (5). One distinguishing property of IRF is that the training process of each tree in this random forest model can be performed independently. 6. Experimentation and Evaluation We sequentially conducted tests for the NLP module and the classiﬁer module using IRF method. Following that, we conducted a survey to evaluate user perceptions of the system. 6.1. The NLP Module With the aim of testing the capability to handle clear rules and logic, as well as predictable situations of the NLP module in the proposed model, we conducted tests on a total of 50 text messages sent to the NLP module. The results indicate that this module operates accurately for all 50 test messages. These messages belong to a series of predeﬁned syntax and semantics structures for	Chunk 12	[-0.004235191, -0.0044930084, -0.04630529, 0.01494921, 0.010739531, 0.012447944, 0.03872009, 0.01136921,

situations of the NLP module in the proposed model, we conducted tests on a total of 50 text messages sent to the NLP module. The results indicate that this module operates accurately for all 50 test messages. These messages belong to a series of predeﬁned syntax and semantics structures for the system. The ability to accurately process all these standard sentences demonstrates the stability and accuracy of the NLP module. Some test results are provided by Table 2. Table 2.

This indicates that the DCG syntax rules and built-in dictionary are not broad enough to encompass all cases. If supplemented with a larger lexicon and more comprehensive DCG rules, the coverage scope of the proposed model will signiﬁcantly improve.Appl. Sci. 2023 ,13, 12446 11 of 13 6.2. Intent Classiﬁer The Intent Classiﬁer is a crucial module in the proposed model. Sentences outside the coverage scope of the NLP module will be classiﬁed by the Intent Classiﬁer. We split the dataset in an 8:2 ratio for training and testing. The training and testing processes were conducted using machine learning methods including improved random forest (IRF), K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, decision tree, Neural Net, as well as deep learning methods such as Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LTSM) [ 22], Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM) [ 23]. Table 3 and Figure 3 present the results of these experiments. The IRF method proved to be superior to other methods with an accuracy of up to 97.69%. Table 3.

x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 15 the dataset in an 8:2 ratio for training and testing. The training and testing processes were conducted using machine learning methods including improved random forest (IRF), K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, decision tree, Neural Net, as well as deep learning methods such as Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LTSM) [22], Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM) [23]. Table 3 and Figure 3 present the re- sults of these experiments. The IRF method proved to be superior to other methods with an accuracy of up to 97.69%. Table 3.

System Testing and Discussion We also conducted surveys with EduChat users using Technology Acceptance Model method [24], asking them, “Is the system easy to use?” with four rating levels (Very con- venient, Quite convenient, Somewhat convenient, Not convenient), and “Does the chatbot provide useful information and solve a signiﬁcant portion of your problems? With four rating levels (Very useful, Quite useful, Somewhat useful, Not useful)”. These surveys were conducted from 23 September 2023, to 3 October 2023 and 28 October 2023 to 30 October 2023, for 40 ﬁrst-year students at the beginning of the ﬁrst semester at HUFLIT University. The evaluation level “convenience” ranges from fairly to very convenient, ac- counting for 85%, corresponding to 34 out of 40 survey participants, and the evaluation level “useful” ranges from fairly to very useful, accounting for 90%.

12446 12 of 13 level “useful” ranges from fairly to very useful, accounting for 90%. The results are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Survey of the usability level of the system. Very Convenient Quite Convenient Somewhat Convenient Not Convenient 40% 45% 10% 5% Very useful Quite useful Somewhat useful Not useful 42.5% 47.5% 5% 5% The participation of the system’s modules was also considered in the statistics. Out of 128 messages sent to the system, 11 were processed by the NLP module, 98 messages were classiﬁed by the machine learning module, and ChatGPT participated in processing 19 messages. Furthermore, we also conducted an analysis of 19 messages that ChatGPT processed. These were general messages about psychological issues, study methods, etc., and ChatGPT provided good advice on these issues. The integration of ChatGPT has made the system more ﬂexible and diverse. From the results above, it can be seen that EduChat is a robust system based on the hybrid combination of both rule-based and machine learning methods. The rule-based approach is highly reliable, easy to verify and interpret, capable of handling limited data, and works well with incomplete data. While machine learning has the capability to learn and improve autonomously from data, achieving high performance in processing large and complex datasets, it can uncover complex patterns and adapt to diverse data without requiring expert knowledge beforehand. Furthermore, EduChat integrates ChatGPT’s API, leveraging all the capabilities of ChatGPT to handle every conversation input to the system effectively . Currently , predictions for the future of chatbots show a strong trend of continued develop- ment. Some potential trends for the future of chatbots may include the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, multi-channel interaction, the development of versatile chatbots, stronger security integration, and improved user experience integration. 7. Conclusions Despite the current advancements in the ﬁelds of NLP , the capabilities of chatbots still have limitations, with a notable example being that these chatbots cannot provide up-to- date information or answers related to events or news. To some extent, in order to address that situation, this paper has presented the architecture and approach used to develop the EduChat system. In EduChat, the NLP and machine learning modules play crucial roles in message processing. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst system in Vietnam that integrates NLP mechanisms, effective machine learning methods, and ChatGPT, creating intelligence and ﬂexibility in the system. The encouraging results of this paper have answered the two research questions posed. This research also opens up new opportunities for the development and expansion of automated conversational systems capable of understanding and communicating in Vietnamese with users. In the future, we plan to train on large datasets for the machine learning module and deﬁne additional rule sets for the natural language processing component to enhance the system’s ﬂexibility and accuracy.
